# About

Notebook classroom is a slim react app, that can be added to Jupyter notebooks 
to publish them as a web application (e.g. on Github pages).

It is called *classroom* as it is intended to be used with lecture content 
stored in Jupyter notebooks, that are compiled to reveal.js slides for 
presentation, HTML for reference and can be loaded in binder to 
to used by your students.

## Note

This is a work in progress application and not finished yet.
This page will give some info about the project one day.

## Use

Using this app is kind of complicated in the current state.
Some hints will be provided on Github, until there is a proper 
release, that can be copied into the lecture repository.
