# About

Notebook classroom is a slim react app, that can be added to Jupyter notebooks 
to publish them as a web application (e.g. on Github pages).

It is called *classroom* as it is intended to be used with lecture content 
stored in Jupyter notebooks, that are compiled to reveal.js slides for 
presentation, HTML for reference and can be loaded in binder to 
be used by your students.

# Maintainer

Notebook-classroom was created by [Mirko MÃ¤licke](https://github.com/mmaelicke) and was then
transferred to his company [hydrocode](https://hydrocode.de). The project is and will stay 
open source, you can build up the page on your own. 
Alternatively, we can get in [contact](mailto:mirko@hydrocode.de) and host your class as a 
service.

# Example

There is a [sample lecture](https://github.com/mmaelicke/sample-lecture) repository, which is 
also [deployed to GitHub Pages](https://mmaelicke.github.io/sample-lecture). This is a 
template repository that can be forked and used.
